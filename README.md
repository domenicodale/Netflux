To show the architecture let us put ourselves in the shoes of a user. This arrives on the web app via a browser, the app service is called to obtain the data needed to view the site by retrieving information from the DB.
At any time the user can communicate with a bot, via the WebChat channel to obtain information. The bot is always synchronized with the Web app using a QnA Maker to answer specific questions or curiosities.
